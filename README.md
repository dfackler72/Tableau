# Tableau
Airline Customer Satisfaction Viz
Capstone project for Springboard Data analysis track - using a data source found on Kaggle.com, I analyzed the data using Excel and Tableau, to determine a course of action for a fictional airline customer satisfaction initiative.  I performed statistical analysis on the data, as well as vizualizing the data from several perspectives and focused on gender and age differences.
